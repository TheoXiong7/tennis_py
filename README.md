# tennis_py
This project uses openCV and various image processing techniques to detect tennis balls. Accuracy and detection of tennis court lines are being implemented.

## Efficiency & Accuracy
On the tested machine, the program ran at 32fps; however, the accuracy still lacks in lower lighting and when there are multiple tennis balls in frame.

## Display
