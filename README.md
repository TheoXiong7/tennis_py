# tennis_py
This project uses openCV and various image processing techniques to detect tennis balls. I am still working on the accuracy and I am also intending on implementing detection of tennis court lines.

## Efficiency & Accuracy
On the tested machine, the program ran at 32fps; however, the accuracy still lacks in lower lighting and when there are multiple tennis balls in frame.

## Display
